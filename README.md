# indices

This python code can convert all numbers of data among any number of processors. i.e from block distribution to cyclic and vise versa see R and S respectively.

The aim of this is to understand how inicies change when converting from block distribution to cyclic and from cyclic distribution to block in parallel computing. 

Here you will enter the number of data you wish to distribute and the number of processors you wish to distribute among and it will give you the output.

It can distribute any number of data among any number of processors.
